# 30 Day Map Challenge 2023
The 30 Day Map Challenge is an exciting opportunity to dive into the world of cartography, data visualization, and creative mapping! 

Each day offers a new theme, hopefully sparking fresh ideas and pushing the boundaries of traditional mapping. 

Whether it's mapping cities, visualizing movement, or experimenting with new data, every map tells a unique story. Completing all 30 days is an ambitious goal, but it‚Äôs all about the journey‚Äîdiscovering new techniques, learning from others, and exploring the many ways maps can reveal insights about our world. Check out my maps below--I'd love to hear from you!

## Day 1: Points

![day1 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day1_points/day1.png)

This was a great opportunity to dive into a species I find fascinating, the Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens). The Indian House Crow is one of Mumbai's most noticeable rent-free residents. These birds can be found scavenging across urban areas and have complex social structures and behaviors. Studies suggest that they may have the intelligence of a 7-year-old human! 

There are four species of crow native to India: 
- Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens)
- Indian Jungle Crow (Corvus culminatus)
- Large-Billed Crow (Corvus macrorhynchos)
- Eastern Jungle Crow (Corvus levaillantii)

This map shows 30 days of citizen observations within a 30-km radius of Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM), the only place in the city where humans can take flight. 

Data from [eBird](https://ebird.org) and using their [API](https://ebird-api-ui.com/observations/nearest-observations-of-a-species). 

Explore interactively with the [Felt Map](https://rebrand.ly/fy9coxr).

## Day 2: Lines

![day2 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day2_lines/day2.png)

For this theme, I decided to take on "Divided Islands," major islands whose land is divided by one or more natural/artificial lines forming an international border.

Made with QGIS.

## Day 3: Polygons

![day3 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day3_polygons/day3.png)

I decided to work with population data I wasn't too familiar with and which turned out to be pretty tough to work with. It was a reminder that we cartographers often pick data that needs extra cleanup and get stuck with self-imposed challenges. Data merging is tough, remember to be nice to yourself this month üòÄ

## Day 4: A Bad Map

![day4 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day4_badmap/day4.png)

Today I was able to explore the impact (sorry not sorry) of meteorites on public-sector policymaking. I made this groundbreaking discovery thanks to the rich layer sets available via Felt's platform.

## Day 5: Analog

![day5 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day5_analog/day5.jfif)

It's always fun to channel your inner child and play with food.

India is a land of regional dietary diversity, with distinct geographic preferences for wheat vs. rice üåæüçö  

Inspired by the ‚ÄúWheat vs Rice‚Äù map by #indiainpixels. 

## Day 6: Asia

![day6 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day6_asia/day6.jpeg) 

Methane plumes are significant climate change contributors--bursts of methane released into the air from natural or human-driven processes.

For this map, I tried out Felt's Clip transform tool--pretty fast and did the job well.

## Day 7: Navigation

![day7 image](https://github.com/jaanekaraster/30-day-map-challenge-23/day7_navigation/1699942451962.jpeg)

The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, driven by colonial interests, mapped the subcontinent in detail with unique methods. 
![map reference](https://github.com/jaanekaraster/30-day-map-challenge-23/day7_navigation/day7_navigation.jpg)

Its precision laid the foundation for modern geospatial technologies. For this I used QGIS' georeferencing and raster calculator tools, and then styled the layer in Felt.

## Day 8: Africa

![day8 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day8_africa/day8_2.png)

I dug up some data on the 60+ museums which hold the highest number of ancient Egyptian artifacts. 

Top countries: 
1. UK: 302K
2. US: 238K
3. Egypt: 150K
4. Germany: 104K
5. France: 84K

## Day 9: Hexagons

![day9 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day9_hexagons/day9_gender.png)

Walking through the streets of Mumbai, you'll likely pass Vijay or Rajshree. But these aren't people. They're apartment names! This was an update from last year's web scraping/NLP effort to see if naming patterns of apartments have a geographic correlation.

## Day 10: North America

![day10 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day10_northamerica/day10.png)

I mapped US & Canada oil and gas wells and pipelines.

## Day 11: Retro
![day11 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day11_retro/day11.png) 

It's amazing to me that we only recently "discovered" that California wasn't actually an island, thanks to Age of Exploration rivalries + religious cartographic certainty + map thievery by pirates. You can learn more about the strange persistence of this misprint myth in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcq9_Tw2eTE) which inspired today's map. 

I took one of the maps and georeferenced it to real-world geographies to explore some correlations.

## Day 12: South America
![day12 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day12_southamerica/day12_1.png)

The Darien Gap, a mountainous jungle region (dis)connecting North and South America, is a notoriously dangerous terrain for hashtag#migrants who must traverse 100-150mi (160-240km) by üõ∂ - üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - üöå

## Day 13: Choropleth
![day13 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day13_choropleth/day13.png)

How many slaves per slaveholder were there in the pre-Civil War American South?

A key cause of the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) was the fundamental disagreement over whether slavery should be allowed to continue. This map shows the ratio of slaves to slaveholders on a countywide basis (1860). 

In the [Felt map](https://rebrand.ly/79fog9z), you can overlay the location of every battle fought during the Civil War period.

Data sourced from National Park Service + IPUMS.

## Day 14: Europe
![day14 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day14_europe/day14.png)

Some 85% of the Danube River's length is navigable; passing through four capitals, it has long been a connector of trade and ideas throughout Europe's heartland.

## Day 16: Oceania
![day16 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day16_oceania/day16.png) 

Oppenheimer marked the start of the nuclear age--tests which led to the forced migration of Pacific Islander populations and the contamination of marine life across the region.

## Day 17: Flow
![day17 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day17_flow/day17.png)

We're now just past the halfway point of the challenge; a sobering reminder that this month is not just about showing off your amazing maps, but also to share your map failures!

In light of this, some learnings from Day 17: 
üëâ hashtag#ChatGPT is a great tool for hashtag#geocoding large data sets if you just need it done quickly üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è
üëâ Despite the SlaveVoyages resource being extremely detailed and well-structured, there were differences in historical place names or vague references based on the primary source data (i.e. "Africa, port unspecified") that needed to be dealt with or filtered out ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
üëâ Once all the point locations were in place, connecting them proved more difficult than expected. I tried and failed to do this using the hashtag#python Searoute library. Maybe the issue was that the AI-geocoded points weren't accessible by sea? For whatever reason, the geocoded CSV and the routing algorithms didn't want to play nice together üò≠
üëâ Fortunately, the hashtag#QGIS plugin ShapeTools came to the rescue, allowing me to make straight-line, geodesic, or Great Circle lines between multiple point layers üéâ

The result: Mapping the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, a sample of 5800+ voyages between 1754 and 1842.

Sometimes you have to lower your expectations and go with the hashtag#flow to simply finish the job.

## Day 18: Atmosphere
![day18 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day18_atmosphere/day18.gif)

Taking an atmosphere-level view using hashtag#landsat, we can see the shifting course of the Brahmaputra river over 20 years. 

Made using the Python [Geemap](https://geemap.org/) package (integrating with Google Earth Engine), featuring a user-friendly interface that allows you to select a region of interest and specify a timelapse series of images to combine into a single GIF. 

Data from Landsat TM-ETM-OLI 2003-2023.

## Day 19: 5-Minute Map

## Day 20: Outdoors
![day20 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day20_outdoors/day20.png)

When hiking in the Western Ghats of India, always: 
- Carry moreüíß than you think you need
- Plan your hike to be underüå≥ by high noon

Having done neither of these things on a hike up to Gumtara Fort, I am lucky and thankful to be alive  üôèüèª

## Day 21: Raster
![day21 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day21_raster/day21.png)

Can you put these states in their proper places? 

With Felt you can import, move and scale images all over the map! 

üß© Felt's interactive capabilities lended themselves to [this puzzle idea](https://rebrand.ly/i9t5erq).

Made with QGIS + Python.

## Day 22: North is Not Always Up

![day22 video](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day22_north/day22.mp4)

üß≠ 1000 years ago, the Global South was the Global North!

![day22 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day22_north/day22_1.png)

I georeferenced a German translation of al-Idrisi's 1154 Arabic-language map (found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8t9s5u/world_map_of_idrisi_1154_ad_upside_down/)) and made it interactive on Felt, showing a few different transformations for context. 

[day22 subimage](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day22_north/day22_2.png)

The result: A vaguely recognizable world especially around the Mediterranean, but getting more and more fanciful as the cartographer speculated on what could be found at the map's far edges. See "Ard Magug" (the Biblical land of Gog and Magog) or "Ard Waq Waq" (Land of Waqwaq, excellent reading on [Arabic Wikipedia](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82_%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82)).

It's still amazing that this level of cartographical accuracy could be achieved just using hand tools and mathematics!

## Day 25: Antarctica
![day25 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day25_antarctica/day25.png) 

Is real-life "dust" (#HisDarkMaterials) revealing a portal to a parallel "anti-verse," where time flows backwards?

[ANITA](https://igc.psu.edu/collaborations/anita/), the Antarctic Impulsive Transit Antenna, has been making multiple flights to study hashtag#neutrinos--nearly massless particles that usually descend from space. However, scientists have observed at least two anomalous points in Antarctica where neutrinos actually are originating from under the ice. 
Some believe this unusual neutrino behavior suggests the existence of a parallel universe or "anti-verse." 

Here's a map showing two possible entry points to the anti-verse once the ice melts--if humans are still around by then. 

Made with QGIS and data from the British Antarctic Survey, University of Hawaii at Manoa, and NASA ([BEDMAP2](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/bedmap-2/)). 


## Day 26: Minimal

üöó It's tough to be a driver in Washington, DC.

Over 108,000 parking tickets were issued in June 2023 alone!
‚û°Ô∏è 96% were issued by the Department of Public Works
‚û°Ô∏è $6.2 million in fines were due, of which $2.2 million were paid
‚û°Ô∏è 10% of all tickets issued were for parking during street cleaning
‚û°Ô∏è Typically, drivers worry about parking too close to a fire hydrant or stop sign, or parking beyond an allotted time. Yet these accounted for only 3% of tickets issued.

üè∞ "Star Wars": Protecting cities with...shapes? 

Bastion forts or "star forts" were all the rage in the 16th-19th centuries. For hundreds of years across Europe and its empires' colonial possessions, these forts' angular geometries and complex architecture stymied invading armies' cannon attacks--until more powerful munitions rendered their design completely irrelevant. 

Here's a bastion fort in the town of Jaca, Spain, overlaid with a star map (or chart?) made in Excel.

üêç Beyond Parseltongue: Harry Potter Translations

Did you know that hashtag#HarryPotter is available in Latin, Yiddish, and Ancient Greek?

My parents gifted me Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 1997 when they saw it at a bookstore. Little did they know then that it would turn into a global mania--becoming one of the world's most translated series of all time.

These books are available in 85 languages, and they continue to be translated into regional languages and dialects. Now if only someone would do hashtag#Klingon...

üåç Explore the [Felt Map](https://rebrand.ly/2uo6z0q) and see the book covers and translations for each language edition: 

Made with [Wikipedia data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_translations) and QGIS. 


## Conclusions
This global online challenge doesn't involve competing against other cartographers for a prize. Instead, it's a competition perhaps more unsettling--you vs. your own expectations. 

A few thoughts that helped me get through this month's mapping marathon:
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Focus on your own growth, instead of comparing with others. There are many paths to completing the challenge (some considered to be unnatural), but find the tools that work best for you. They should be challenging enough that you push yourself, but not so challenging that you get stuck on one approach to making a map and never move on to the next one. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏è When you do find yourself doomscrolling through others' maps, see them as a source of inspiration rather than rivalry. What tech tools/design principles did they use? Incorporate these ideas into your own maps.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Likes and reposts don't necessarily reflect the amount of effort put into a map. Some maps that took me the shortest time to make ended up being the most "popular" due to social media algorithms that seem to reward colorful shiny objects...
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Therefore, your assessment of what makes a map "good" needs to be found within yourself and how you value it, rather than through unpredictable waves of external validation. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Given the amount of hashtag#opendata out there, making your map stand out is more about how you translate that data into a map that shows thoughtful hashtag#design and tells a clear story to your audience (hashtag#datastorytelling).
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Finally, making web-worthy hashtag#maps is hard!

With these thoughts in mind, sharing my approach and toolkit: 
Unlike the previous year where I focused on making each map exclusively in hashtag#RStudio, this year I wanted to push the boundaries of Felt's new features and discover ways to automate the mapmaking process. 

‚ú® ChatGPT: Quickly geocoding large data sets and debugging Python code
üêç Excel and hashtag#Python: Previewing, cleaning up and curating data sets 
üåé QGIS: Exploring geospatial data sets locally (useful for low-bandwidth situations during the Challenge) and creating/editing data
üåê Felt: Importing/styling maps, performing transformations like clipping and buffering on-the-fly, and unlocking a way to share and explore maps interactively

Shoutout to Felt for accelerating the process to develop and deploy many of these maps! 

Thanks also to Topi Tjukanov for starting this challenge and providing a space for aspiring and experienced hashtag#cartographers and hashtag#GIS experts to get creative, collaborate, and learn new skills.
