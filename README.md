# 30 Day Map Challenge 2023
The 30 Day Map Challenge is an exciting opportunity to dive into the world of cartography, data visualization, and creative mapping! 

Each day offers a new theme, hopefully sparking fresh ideas and pushing the boundaries of traditional mapping. 

Whether it's mapping cities, visualizing movement, or experimenting with new data, every map tells a unique story. Completing all 30 days is an ambitious goal, but it‚Äôs all about the journey‚Äîdiscovering new techniques, learning from others, and exploring the many ways maps can reveal insights about our world. 

## This year's focus: Felt

This year, I was an "ambassador" (read: early adopter) for the new Felt mapping platform. So my goal was to test the limits of their platform with as many maps as possible for this challenge. 

Note: Felt changed its business model in early 2024, and has paywalled many of its basic features which were available in 2023. Unfortunately there is no plan to accommodate projects which were completed before this change, and as a result, the Felt maps below are no longer fully visible. 

A good lesson to freelancers to prioritize open source, and a good goal for next year's challenge :)

Check out my maps below--I'd love to hear from you!

## Day 1: Points

![day1 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day1_points/day1.png)

This was a great opportunity to dive into a species I find fascinating, the Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens). The Indian House Crow is one of Mumbai's most noticeable rent-free residents. These birds can be found scavenging across urban areas and have complex social structures and behaviors. Studies suggest that they may have the intelligence of a 7-year-old human! 

There are four species of crow native to India: 
- Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens)
- Indian Jungle Crow (Corvus culminatus)
- Large-Billed Crow (Corvus macrorhynchos)
- Eastern Jungle Crow (Corvus levaillantii)

This map shows 30 days of citizen observations within a 30-km radius of Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM), the only place in the city where humans can take flight. 

Data from [eBird](https://ebird.org) and using their [API](https://ebird-api-ui.com/observations/nearest-observations-of-a-species). 

Explore interactively with the [Felt Map](https://rebrand.ly/fy9coxr).

## Day 2: Lines

![day2 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day2_lines/day2.png)

For this theme, I decided to take on "Divided Islands," major islands whose land is divided by one or more natural/artificial lines forming an international border.

Made with QGIS.

## Day 3: Polygons

![day3 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day3_polygons/day3.png)

I decided to work with population data I wasn't too familiar with and which turned out to be pretty tough to work with. It was a reminder that we cartographers often pick data that needs extra cleanup and get stuck with self-imposed challenges. Data merging is tough, remember to be nice to yourself this month üòÄ

## Day 4: A Bad Map

![day4 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day4_badmap/day4.png)

Today I was able to explore the impact (sorry not sorry) of meteorites on public-sector policymaking. I made this groundbreaking discovery thanks to the rich layer sets available via Felt's platform.

## Day 5: Analog

![day5 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day5_analog/day5.jfif)

It's always fun to channel your inner child and play with food.

India is a land of regional dietary diversity, with distinct geographic preferences for wheat vs. rice üåæüçö  

Inspired by the ‚ÄúWheat vs Rice‚Äù map by #indiainpixels. 

## Day 6: Asia

![day6 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day6_asia/day6.jpeg) 

Methane plumes are significant climate change contributors--bursts of methane released into the air from natural or human-driven processes.

For this map, I tried out Felt's Clip transform tool--pretty fast and did the job well.

## Day 7: Navigation

![day7 image](https://github.com/jaanekaraster/30-day-map-challenge-23/day7_navigation/1699942451962.jpeg)

The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, driven by colonial interests, mapped the subcontinent in detail with unique methods. 
![map reference](https://github.com/jaanekaraster/30-day-map-challenge-23/day7_navigation/day7_navigation.jpg)

Its precision laid the foundation for modern geospatial technologies. For this I used QGIS' georeferencing and raster calculator tools, and then styled the layer in Felt.

## Day 8: Africa

![day8 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day8_africa/day8_2.png)

This day was more of a data visualization exercise, to understand where ancient Egyptian artifacts are on display (or, more likely, in storage) around the world.

I dug up some data on the 60+ museums which hold the highest number of ancient Egyptian artifacts and dropped the sheet into Felt for a quick visualization.

Top countries: 
1. UK: 302K
2. US: 238K
3. Egypt: 150K
4. Germany: 104K
5. France: 84K

## Day 9: Hexagons

![day9 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day9_hexagons/day9_gender.png)

In the US, we tend to name buildings using famous surnames or areas, such as "The Biltmore" or "Garden View." It's less common to see buildings named "Robert" or "Maria." In India, however, this is a relatively common practice, finding a "Vijay" or "Rajshree" building as you walk down the street. 

This map was an update from last year's web scraping/NLP effort around apartment names in Mumbai. Last year's map had been made in R and wasn't optimized for public exploration, so I dropped the data into Felt to help viewers discover geographic correlations.

## Day 10: North America

![day10 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day10_northamerica/day10.png)

I mapped US & Canada oil and gas wells and pipelines. It was a challenge to get this data as it wasn't all contained within a single source, but the visualization does the job.

## Day 11: Retro
![day11 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day11_retro/day11.png) 

It's amazing to me that we only recently "discovered" that California wasn't actually an island, thanks to Age of Exploration rivalries + religious cartographic certainty + map thievery by pirates. You can learn more about the strange persistence of this misprint myth in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcq9_Tw2eTE) which inspired today's map. 

I took one of the maps and georeferenced it to real-world geographies to explore some correlations.

## Day 12: South America
![day12 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day12_southamerica/day12_1.png)

The Darien Gap, a mountainous jungle region (dis)connecting North and South America, is a notoriously dangerous terrain for migrants who must traverse 100-150mi (160-240km) by üõ∂ - üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - üöå  Starting from maps like [this one](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/100506) from UNHCR, I wanted to help the viewer decide which path to take by zooming and panning the map, and turning layers on and off to better understand the rugged topography.

## Day 13: Choropleth
![day13 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day13_choropleth/day13.png)

How many slaves per slaveholder were there in the pre-Civil War American South?

A key cause of the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) was the fundamental disagreement over whether slavery should be allowed to continue. This map shows the ratio of slaves to slaveholders on a countywide basis (1860). IPUMS has a wonderful archive of historical boundaries for the US, which helped provide accurate context for the map's content. I went for a muted green gradient to match the tan base layer, giving more of a historical map feel. 

In the [Felt map](https://rebrand.ly/79fog9z), you can overlay the location of every battle fought during the Civil War period.

Data sourced from National Park Service + IPUMS.

## Day 14: Europe
![day14 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day14_europe/day14.png)

Some 85% of the Danube River's length is navigable; passing through four capitals, it has long been a connector of trade and ideas throughout Europe's heartland.

The challenge of this map was being able to show the topography, watersheds, and population in a single map. I explored how Felt could easily clip, buffer, and aggregate data all within the browser. I created buffers within 50km/30mi of the Danube and its arteries, clipped the population data on these buffers, and annotated the map with the capitals along the Danube.

## Day 15: OSM
![day15 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day15_osm/day15.png)

Mumbai, a city of around 25 million including the metro area, is one of the world's rapidly expanding "megacities." It has several local train lines and a single metro, but many more metro lines are planned and in progress. One of the big questions today is what proportion of this urban population will actually use these Metro lines once they're finished, and how much these lines will reduce road traffic in the process. 

Given these developments, which areas are within a 1km or less walking distance from each station? (Showing only currently completed lines)

Thanks to Geoff Boeing for the [OSMNX](https://geoffboeing.com/publications/osmnx-paper/) Python package which creates road networks from OSM; I used various isochrone plugins in QGIS to find the road network distances.

## Day 16: Oceania
![day16 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day16_oceania/day16.png) 

Oppenheimer marked the start of the nuclear age--tests which led to the forced migration of Pacific Islander populations and the contamination of marine life across the region. This map aimed to communicate both the scale of these tests and of the Pacific Ocean itself. Multiple lengths of the United States could fit inside the South Pacific and you still wouldn't reach Asia!

## Day 17: Flow
![day17 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day17_flow/day17.png)

This day was just past the halfway point of the challenge, and for me, a reminder that this month is not just about showing off one's amazing maps, but also one's map failures!

Some learnings from Day 17: 
üëâ ChatGPT is a great tool for geocoding large data sets if you just need it done quickly.
üëâ Despite the SlaveVoyages resource being extremely detailed and well-structured, there were differences in historical place names or vague references based on the primary source data (i.e. "Africa, port unspecified") that needed to be dealt with or filtered out.
üëâ Once all the point locations were in place, connecting them proved more difficult than expected. I tried and failed to do this using the Python Searoute library. Maybe the issue was that the AI-geocoded points weren't accessible by sea? For whatever reason, the geocoded CSV and the routing algorithms didn't want to play nice together.
üëâ Fortunately, the QGIS plugin ShapeTools came to the rescue, allowing me to make straight-line, geodesic, or Great Circle lines between multiple point layers.

The result: Mapping the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, a sample of 5800+ voyages between 1754 and 1842.

Sometimes you have to lower your expectations and "go with the flow" to simply finish the job. Of all the maps from the challenge, this was one of those I was most proud of, and I felt it communicated the topic effectively while allowing for viewer exploration.

## Day 18: Atmosphere
![day18 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day18_atmosphere/day18.gif)

This map used the Python [Geemap](https://geemap.org/) package, which integrates with Google Earth Engine. Geemap allows you to access GEE, get satellite data, and run it within Colab notebooks or locally--making it easy to swap out data sources, run multiple iterations, and get standardized outputs that save time. This is particularly valuable for satellite imagery, since those images can take up huge amounts of hard drive space--much better to connect to a streaming service so that you have it only when you need it. I simply selected a region of interest and specified a timelapse series of images to combine into a single GIF. 

This map also taught me that a map's popularity and your individual level of effort don't always correlate. This was just a few lines of code based on the Geemap tutorial to export the images into a GIF, but it got several thousand impressions and hundreds of likes on social media. My theory is that it had bright colors, referenced some popular or trending hashtags like Python and Geemap, and was an eye-catching animation. But who knows. 

At any rate, it was pretty cool to see the shifting course of the Brahmaputra river over 20 years, from an atmosphere-level view using LANDSAT imagery.

## Day 19: 5-Minute Map
![day19 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day19_5minutemap/day19.MOV)

I always like these opportunities to make analog maps because they make you really think about where things are in relation to each other. I had to draw a few rounds of Iceland's shape before I got one that I was happy with, then furiously added fill, annotations, and of course the flag to complete it in 5 minutes. 

Did you know that people in Iceland sometimes speak "on inhalation"--that initial unconscious breath we take when opening our mouths to speak?

## Day 20: Outdoors
![day20 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day20_outdoors/day20.png)

This outdoors map took me back to a hike I did in the Western Ghats of India. A tough lesson was learned: 
- Carry moreüíß than you think you need
- Plan your hike to be underüå≥ by high noon

I did neither of these things, and an additional source of anxiety was my phone's steadily-depleting battery, which was doing the most important thing: logging GPS for posterity. 

I'm lucky and thankful to be alive, and also for the nice track that I can now look back on. Priorities are priorities, I guess.

## Day 21: Raster
![day21 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day21_raster/day21.png)

This day focused on using Felt as a game platform, since one could easily drop in raster files and rearrange them, which you can't do as easily in QGIS. Starting simple, I had to consider how to cut out the shapes of each state, which I did in Felt itself. Felt allowed me to import, move and scale images. 

The result: A virtual jigsaw puzzle üß© of US states, enabled by  Felt's interactive capabilities. Solve the puzzle [here](https://rebrand.ly/i9t5erq).

## Day 22: North is Not Always Up

<video width="640" height="360" controls loop="" muted = "" autoplay="">

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

When we look at a standard world map, North is always "up." But North and South, up and down are abstract constructs that have no meaning outside the context we give them at this particular place and time. If you looked at a map made 1000 years ago, you'd see that today's "Global South" is actually "north" or "up." 

This map sought to bring the medieval and modern together in a single animation. 

![day22 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day22_north/day22_1.png)

I georeferenced a German translation of al-Idrisi's 1154 Arabic-language map (found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8t9s5u/world_map_of_idrisi_1154_ad_upside_down/)) and made it interactive on Felt, showing a few different transformations for context. 

[day22 subimage](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day22_north/day22_2.png)

The result: A vaguely recognizable world especially around the Mediterranean, but getting more and more fanciful as the cartographer speculated on what could be found at the map's far edges. See "Ard Magug" (the Biblical land of Gog and Magog) or "Ard Waq Waq" (Land of Waqwaq, excellent reading on [Arabic Wikipedia](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82_%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82)).

It's still amazing that this level of cartographical accuracy could be achieved in medieval times just using hand tools and mathematics!

## Day 23: 3D

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Mapping LOTR Locationsüåã

Watching The Rings of Power series, I struggled to find a detailed map connecting these new locations to the familiar Middle-Earth map from The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, set thousands of years later in the Third Age ("3D Age"). 

So I made a more complete map made using QGIS, with 3D topographical features!

Thanks to [ME-GIS](https://github.com/andrewheiss/ME-GIS) for the digital elevation model (DEM) of Middle-Earth. 

## Day 24: Black and White

üî≤üî≥üî≤üî≥üî≤üî≥üî≤üî≥üî≤

I decided to take "black and white" in the toponymic sense, namely focusing on Belarus (meaning "White Russia") and Montenegro (meaning "Black Mountain.") But why stop there? Let's get the number of zebra crossings in each to fit the theme.

## Day 25: Antarctica
![day25 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day25_antarctica/day25.png) 

Social media is giving us a lot more sensationalist material these days, blurring the line between our reality and the world of fantasy. A fan of the His Dark Materials (Golden Compass, etc.) series, this made me think about real-life places to find this mythical "dust" where the borders between worlds can be crossed. And what better place to look than one of the last frontiers--Antarctica?

In need of some inspiration for today's challenge, I came across an [article](https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/anchordoqui/ANITA-new-Scientist.pdf) on some mysterious particles which had been discovered in the Antarctic that could reveal a portal to a parallel "anti-verse", where time flows backwards. 

[ANITA](https://igc.psu.edu/collaborations/anita/), the Antarctic Impulsive Transit Antenna, has been making multiple flights to study neutrinos--nearly massless particles that usually descend from space. However, scientists have observed at least two anomalous points in Antarctica where neutrinos actually are originating from under the ice. 
Some believe this unusual neutrino behavior suggests the existence of a parallel universe or "anti-verse." 

Today's speculative map showed two possible entry points to the anti-verse once the ice melts--if humans are still around by then. 

Made with QGIS and data from the British Antarctic Survey, University of Hawaii at Manoa, and NASA ([BEDMAP2](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/bedmap-2/)). 


## Day 26: Minimal

[ËâØÂìÅË®àÁîª(MUJI)](https://www.muji.us/) is known for its "minimalist" aesthetic. 

With only 4 locations in India, this map also took me minimal effort to make!

## Day 27: Dots

Municipalities are amazing sources of standardized data, so today's map used data from [Open Data DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/).

![day27 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day27_dots/day27.png)

With this data we can answer some important questions, like what it's like to be a driver in Washington, DC. Where are the most parking tickets issued, and how much revenue does this generate for the city? 

The results: 
Over 108,000 parking tickets were issued in June 2023 alone!
‚û°Ô∏è 96% were issued by the Department of Public Works
‚û°Ô∏è $6.2 million in fines were due, of which $2.2 million were paid
‚û°Ô∏è 10% of all tickets issued were for parking during street cleaning
‚û°Ô∏è Typically, drivers worry about parking too close to a fire hydrant or stop sign, or parking beyond an allotted time. Yet these accounted for only 3% of tickets issued. 

You can explore the stats with the [Felt Map](https://rebrand.ly/0owi5ei)

Made using: 
‚û°Ô∏è QGIS and Topi Tjukanov's tutorial on [geogiffery with Time Manager plugin](https://medium.com/@tjukanov/geogiffery-in-a-nutshell-introduction-to-qgis-time-manager-31bb79f2af19)
‚û°Ô∏è Python (Pillow library) to turn the set of images into a GIF
‚û°Ô∏è Excel for pivot tables 

This map also got a lot of support on social media, possibly because it was shiny and animated. 

## Day 28: Chart or Map

üè∞ "Star Wars": Protecting cities with...shapes? 

Bastion forts or "star forts" were all the rage in the 16th-19th centuries. For hundreds of years across Europe and its empires' colonial possessions, these forts' angular geometries and complex architecture stymied invading armies' cannon attacks. That is, until the development of more powerful munitions in the 19th century rendered their design completely irrelevant. 

Above is a bastion fort in the town of Jaca, Spain, overlaid with a star map (or chart?) made in Excel. So we have a chart, and a map. 

How many star forts does your country have? [Explore the map with Felt.](https://rebrand.ly/r3w7hui)

üêç Beyond Parseltongue: Harry Potter Translations

Did you know that Harry Potter is available in Latin, Yiddish, and Ancient Greek?

My parents gifted me Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 1997 when they saw it at a bookstore. Little did they know then that it would turn into a global mania--becoming one of the world's most translated series of all time. 

![day30 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/day30_favorite/day30.png)

These books are available in 85 languages, and they continue to be translated into regional languages and dialects. Now if only someone would do Klingon...

üåç Explore the [Felt Map](https://rebrand.ly/2uo6z0q) and see the book covers and translations for each language edition: 

Made with [Wikipedia data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_translations) and QGIS. 


## Conclusions
This global online challenge doesn't involve competing against other cartographers for a prize. Instead, it's a competition perhaps more unsettling--you vs. your own expectations. 

A few thoughts that helped me get through this month's mapping marathon:
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Focus on your own growth, instead of comparing with others. There are many paths to completing the challenge (some considered to be unnatural), but find the tools that work best for you. They should be challenging enough that you push yourself, but not so challenging that you get stuck on one approach to making a map and never move on to the next one. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏è When you do find yourself doomscrolling through others' maps, see them as a source of inspiration rather than rivalry. What tech tools/design principles did they use? Incorporate these ideas into your own maps.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Likes and reposts don't necessarily reflect the amount of effort put into a map. Some maps that took me the shortest time to make ended up being the most "popular" due to social media algorithms that seem to reward colorful shiny objects...
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Therefore, your assessment of what makes a map "good" needs to be found within yourself and how you value it, rather than through unpredictable waves of external validation. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Given the amount of open data out there, making your map stand out is more about how you translate that data into a map that shows thoughtful design and tells a clear story to your audience.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Finally, making web-worthy maps is hard!

With these thoughts in mind, sharing my approach and toolkit: 
Unlike the previous year where I focused on making each map exclusively in RStudio, this year I wanted to push the boundaries of Felt's new features and discover ways to automate the mapmaking process.
